<p>Hello and welcome to my sneaker site! My vision for this website is to allow you to not only come here to purchase highly sought after sneakers, 
  but also to bring your own collection and see what's out there to trade, or sell! I want to turn this website into a community and hope to satisfy customers from all over the globe.
  The sneaker community is a beautiful one with much to be had, so find your pair of "Holy Grail's" and start your own collection today!</p>
